# String Data Type

# A string is a sequence of characters.
# A string literal uses single-quotes or double-quotes: 'Hello World' or "Hello World".
# For strings, '+' means concatenate.
# When a string contains numbers, it is still a string.
# We can convert a string containing numbers into a number by using the function int()

def main():
    fruit = 'banana'
    letter = fruit[1]
    print(letter) # it is going to print 'a'
    
    x = 3
    w = fruit[x - 1]
    print(w) # it is going to print 'n'

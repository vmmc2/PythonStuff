# String Library.

# Python has a number of string functions which are in the string library.
# These functions are already built into every single string - we invoke them by appending the function to the string variable.
# These functions do not modify the original string. Instead, they return a new string that has been altered.

greet = "Hello Bob"
print(greet)
zap = greet.lower() # pego a string greet, deixo todos os seus caracterers como letras minusculas e retorno essa nova string.
print(zap)

print("Hello There, Baby".lower())

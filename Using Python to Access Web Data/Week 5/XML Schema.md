# XML Schema

* __Verification is not the act of sending/receiving or serializing/de-serializing data. It is the act of checking if the data is in the correct format.__
* XML Schema is just __the description of the legal format of an XML document.__
* Expressed in terms of constraints on the structure and content of documents.
* The XML Schema is often used to specify a "contract" between systems. - "My system will only accept XML that conforms to this particular Schema."
* If a particular piece of XML meets the specification on the Schema, it is said to "validate".

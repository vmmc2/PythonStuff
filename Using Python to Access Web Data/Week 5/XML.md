# XML

## Intro
* XML is just another serialization format.
* As any other type of serialization format, it has some special characters (called active characters) that are used to highlight the information inside the document.
* The XML serialization format was responsible for influencing the HTML format.
* The XML serialization format has 2 different types of elements/nodes:
  * __Simple Element:__ An element/node that has only a text inside of it.
  * __Complex Element:__ An element/node that has child/children nodes inside of it.

## About Python Scripts
* Interactive Python is good when you are coding an experiment or tiny programs (Usually each one of them will have 3/4 lines of code).
* Do not use the interactive functionality to write whole and large programs. Instead, use a text editor or an IDE to write a Python file (.py). After that, we are going to tell python to run the programs inside that file. To do that take a look at the example below:
```shell
python3 example_python_file.py
```
* In a sense, we are giving Python a script for it to run.
